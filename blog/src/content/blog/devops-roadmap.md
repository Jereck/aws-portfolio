After years of building full-stack applications, Iâ€™ve decided to pivot into DevOps. I wanted to share what Iâ€™ve learned, what tools Iâ€™m using, and how Iâ€™m approaching the shift.

## Why DevOps?

The DevOps field is not only in demand, but it also overlaps heavily with what I already enjoy: automation, deployment pipelines, and infrastructure.

## My Roadmap

Here's the breakdown I'm following:

1. **Linux + Shell scripting**
2. **Git + GitHub Actions**
3. **AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, CloudFront, Route 53)**
4. **Terraform for IaC**
5. **Docker + Kubernetes**
6. **Monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana**

Iâ€™ll keep this post updated as I go.
