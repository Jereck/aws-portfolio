When you're getting started with AWS, it's easy to overlook IAM. But trust me — **it's one of the most important services you need to understand** if you're going to work in cloud or DevOps roles.

## 🛡️ Why IAM Matters

IAM stands for **Identity and Access Management**, and it's how AWS controls *who can do what*. If S3 is your storage and EC2 is your compute, IAM is the security gate standing between them.

Without proper IAM setup:
- Anyone (or anything) could potentially access your infrastructure.
- You risk **leaking credentials**, **overprovisioning access**, or even **losing control** over your account.

A strong IAM foundation is what separates a hobby project from production-grade infrastructure.

## 🔐 IAM Concepts You Need to Know

Here are the core building blocks:

- **Users** – people or services with long-term credentials.
- **Groups** – collections of users that share permissions.
- **Roles** – temporary identities often assumed by EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or external services.
- **Policies** – JSON documents that define what users/roles/groups can and can’t do.

> 💡 Pro tip: Prefer **roles** over long-lived users for anything automated (like CI/CD, Lambda, EC2).

## ⚙️ IAM in Practice – Example

Here’s how to create a simple IAM user with S3 read-only access:

### Step 1: Create the Policy

Go to **IAM > Policies > Create policy**, and use this JSON:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
